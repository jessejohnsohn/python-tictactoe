I made this game as part of a 2-hour Coding Challenge at The Tech Academy. 

Features:

- Alternates X and O automatically, based on modulus and auto-increments (rather than have separate modules for X and O turns).
- Recognizes every possible winning combination.
- Asks to play again. Answers are sanitized for upper and lower-case, as well as whitespace. "Yes", "Y", and "Okay" are acceptable answers.
- Recognizes a Cat's Game (tie) and asks to play again.
- Pretty robust and hard-to-break.
